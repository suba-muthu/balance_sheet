    * The tr element defines a table row, the th element defines a table header, and the td element defines a table cell.
* caption element - defines a table caption.It's must be inserted immediately after the table tag.
* span element -  It is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
* :first-of-type selector - It's matches every element that is the first child, of a particular type, of its parent.
    * h1 .flex span:first-of-type
* :last-of-type selector - It's matches every element that is the last child, of a particular type, of its parent.
    * h1 .flex span:last-of-type
* :nth-of-type selector - matches every element that is the nth child, of the same type (tag name), of its parent.
    * tr.total td:nth-of-type(3)
* !important - This rule in CSS is used to add more importance to a property/value than normal.

    * border-collapse: collapse;
    * collapse - Borders are collapsed into a single border when possible (border-spacing and empty-cells properties have no effect).
